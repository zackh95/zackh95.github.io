So I'm working on building this website that will be hosted with github-pages. I'm using Jekyll in order to handle a lot of the web development stuff that I'm not good at. Still working on figuring everything out. Hopefully I'll be manage to customize the lanyon-plus theme I'm using at some point.

My main goal for this site/blog is to use it as some sort of external resum√© to hold more detailed school/career achievements, as well as cool stuff I've been working on. Let's have at it.
